# ma-goals
App that helps you achieve your ambitious goals by focusing on the marginal improvements towards the goals.

## origin
This app is inspired by this TED-ex talk: [How to Achieve Your Most Ambitious Goals | Stephen Duneier | TEDxTucson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQMbvJNRpLE) on Youtube

## idea
0. It's a mobile app that enables you to list down your ambitious `Goal`s
1. A `Goal` can be categorized as `Todo`, `In-progress` or `Done`
2. For each of them, break it down into tasks/habits/marginal-improvements. Let's call these `Tasks`
3. Each of these `Task`s can be further broken down into smaller `Task`s
4. You should be able to easily see this and feel that `Task`s can be broken down into smaller and smaller `Task`s
5. A task can be categorized as `Todo`, `In-progress` or `Done`
6. If all children `Task`s of a parent `Task` are `Done`, the parent task is automatically categorized as `Done`
7. If all `Task`s of a goal are `Done`, the goal is automatically categorized as `Done` (Yay!)
